Welcome to the Reproducible Research with R short course! We look forward to meeting you in person. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework:

+ Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the course. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember).

+ Complete this [10-minute interactive tutorial on Markdown.](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)
